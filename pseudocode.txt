MAIN METHOD (BagDemo):
    - Create Bag<Integer> called voteBag
    - Add vote IDs (e.g., 101, 102, etc.) to simulate voting
    - PRINT initial vote counts
    - CHECK if specific candidates are present
    - PRINT count of votes per candidate
    - REMOVE one vote for candidate 101
    - PRINT updated vote counts
    - REMOVE all votes for candidate 103 (once, since only one vote)
    - PRINT final vote counts

    // NEW:
    - PRINT total number of votes using size()
    - Create second Bag with more votes (simulate different region)
    - Merge second Bag into voteBag using merge()
    - PRINT merged vote counts
    - Create distinct bag with one occurrence per candidate
    - PRINT distinct candidates
